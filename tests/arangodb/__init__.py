"""
ArangoDB integration tests.

This package contains tests for verifying the functionality of
the ArangoDB integration, ensuring that database operations,
search functionality, and relationship management work as expected.

All tests use real data and database operations rather than mocks,
and verify specific expected values rather than generic assertions.
