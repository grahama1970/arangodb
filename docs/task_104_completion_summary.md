2. 
   - Displays RL metrics in card format
   - Formats numbers, percentages, and decimals
   - Color-coded by metric type

3. 
   - Real-time pipeline execution display
   - Status indicators and timing
   - Module filtering support

4. 
   - D3.js force-directed graph
   - Interactive node selection
   - Drag and zoom capabilities

5. 
   - Custom WebSocket hook
   - Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
   - Message handling and state management

#### Test Files (4 files):

### Test Results
- Test 104.1: Dashboard renders ✅ (0.3s)
- Test 104.2: WebSocket updates ✅ (0.8s)
- Test 104.3: Graph interactions ✅ (0.5s)
- Test 104.H: Honeypot snapshot ❌ (Expected failure)

**Total Duration**: 1.603s (within 0.1s-3.0s range ✅)

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live metrics
2. **Interactive Visualization**: D3.js graph with click/drag support
3. **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS with mobile support
4. **Component Reusability**: Using granger-shared-ui components
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful WebSocket disconnection handling

### Integration Points
- ✅ Connected to Chat backend dashboard API (Task #101)
- ✅ Uses D3 visualization from Task #103
- ✅ Ready for RL metrics from Task #102
- ✅ Prepared for learning curves (Task #105)
- ✅ Prepared for pipeline timeline (Task #106)

### Next Steps
With Task #104 complete, the following tasks can now proceed:
- **Task #105**: Implement Learning Curves Visualization
- **Task #106**: Add Pipeline Execution Timeline

Both tasks have their dependencies met and can be started immediately.
