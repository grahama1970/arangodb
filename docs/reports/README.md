# Reports Directory

This directory contains task completion reports for the ArangoDB project.

## Structure

Each task file in `/docs/tasks/` has a corresponding report file here with the same name plus `_report` suffix.

Example:
- Task: `/docs/tasks/024_critical_graphiti_features.md`
- Report: `/docs/reports/024_critical_graphiti_features_report.md`

## Report Contents

Each report must contain:
1. **Task Overview**: Brief description of the task
2. **Implementation Status**: What was implemented
3. **ArangoDB Queries**: Human-readable queries with actual execution
4. **Results**: Non-mocked results from actual database operations
5. **Performance Metrics**: Timing and resource usage
6. **Issues and Limitations**: Any problems encountered
7. **Next Steps**: What remains to be done

## Guidelines

- Use actual ArangoDB queries and results (no mocking)
- Include performance metrics for all operations
- Document any limitations or issues discovered
- Update report as implementation progresses
- Re-evaluate report after all tasks complete to verify completion

## Status Indicators

- ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**: Feature fully implemented with all tests passing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL**: Feature partially implemented 
- ‚ùå **NOT STARTED**: Feature not yet implemented
- üîÑ **IN PROGRESS**: Currently being worked on

## ArangoDB Queries and Results

### Query 1: [Description]
```aql
FOR doc IN collection
  FILTER doc.field == @value
  RETURN doc
```

**Result:**
```json

  "_key": "123",
  "field": "value"
}
```

## Performance Metrics
