## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Data Model (`sparta_data_enhanced.py`)

#### Comprehensive Threat Coverage
```python
# Expanded from 9 to 13 tactics
TACTICS = [
    "Reconnaissance", "Resource Development", "Initial Access",
    "Execution", "Persistence", "Privilege Escalation", 
    "Defense Evasion", "Discovery", "Lateral Movement",
    "Collection", "Command and Control", "Exfiltration", "Impact"
]

# Expanded from 13 to 25+ techniques with full metadata
- Added threat actor types enum
- Added comprehensive technique attributes:
  - Prerequisites
  - Indicators
  - Platforms
  - Data sources
  - Required resources
```

#### Real-World Scenarios
- Nation State Satellite Takeover
- Competitor Industrial Espionage  
- Hacktivist Disruption

### 2. Advanced Risk Calculation (`threat_calculator.py`)

#### Multi-Factor Risk Model
```python
Risk = (Impact × Likelihood × Detection Difficulty) / Mitigation Effectiveness

Where:
- Impact: Severity-based (Critical=1.0 to Low=0.25)
- Likelihood: Inverse of exploitation complexity
- Detection: Difficulty to detect (Very Hard=1.0 to Very Easy=0.2)
- Mitigation: Non-linear effectiveness based on countermeasures
```

#### Attack Chain Analysis
- Cumulative risk assessment
- Chain complexity calculation
- Detection probability modeling
- Critical path identification

#### System Resilience Metrics
- Weighted resilience scoring
- Coverage analysis by severity
- Mitigation effectiveness tracking

### 3. Modern V0 Design System (`matrix_generator_v0.py`)

#### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Fluid layouts with Tailwind CSS
- Adaptive components

#### Visual Aesthetics
- Gradient backgrounds
- Soft shadows and depth
- Smooth animations (250ms cubic-bezier)
- Modern typography (Inter font)

#### Interactive Features
- Real-time search
- Multi-criteria filtering
- Hover tooltips with rich information
- Click-through detailed modals
- Keyboard navigation

### 4. Comprehensive Testing (`test_sparta_module.py`)

#### Test Coverage
- Data processing tests
- Risk calculation validation
- Attack chain analysis
- Integration tests
- Performance benchmarks

#### Edge Cases
- Empty data handling
- Invalid input validation
- Extreme risk scenarios

### 5. CLI Integration (`sparta_commands.py`)

#### Commands Implemented
1. `generate` - Create visualizations
2. `stats` - Display matrix statistics
3. `search` - Find techniques
4. `export` - Export data (JSON/CSV)
5. `scenarios` - View attack scenarios
6. `analyze` - Analyze attack chains

### 6. Production Features

#### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of data
- Efficient D3.js rendering
- Minimal re-renders

#### Accessibility
- WCAG AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- High contrast mode

#### Export Capabilities
- JSON with full metadata
- CSV for analysis
- PDF reports (planned)
- PowerPoint integration (planned)
