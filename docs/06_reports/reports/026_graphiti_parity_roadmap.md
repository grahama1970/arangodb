   - All Graphiti features implemented
   - Temporal queries working correctly
   - Contradiction detection accurate

2. **Performance**
   - Sub-second query response times
   - Efficient temporal operations
   - Scalable to millions of entities

3. **User Experience**
   - Intuitive CLI commands

## Conclusion

Achieving Graphiti parity will transform our ArangoDB implementation into a state-of-the-art temporal knowledge graph system. By building on our existing strengths in conversation memory management and leveraging ArangoDB's capabilities, we can create a system that matches and potentially exceeds Graphiti's functionality.

The phased approach ensures we deliver value incrementally while maintaining system stability. The bi-temporal foundation is critical and must be implemented first, as all other advanced features depend on it.

With proper resources and execution, we can achieve full parity within 12 weeks while maintaining our unique advantages in conversation management and developer experience.
