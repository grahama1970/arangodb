# Memory Agent Vector Search Fix Report

## Issue Summary
The memory agent was using text-based BM25 search instead of APPROX_NEAR_COSINE vector search, even when storing embeddings. This was causing the test `test_memory_search_basic` to fail when expecting vector search results.

## Root Cause
The original code had a comment indicating "limitations with APPROX_NEAR_COSINE in complex queries." Investigation revealed that APPROX_NEAR_COSINE fails with error "[HTTP 500][ERR 1554] AQL: failed vector search" when combined with filter conditions in AQL queries.

## Solution Implemented
Modified the `MemoryAgent.search()` method to:
1. Use APPROX_NEAR_COSINE vector search when no filters are applied
2. Fall back to BM25 text search when filters are present (conversation_id or point_in_time)
3. Normalize vector search scores from [-1, 1] to [0, 1] for consistency

## Code Changes
Updated `/src/arangodb/core/memory/memory_agent.py`:
- Added conditional logic to determine when vector search can be used
- Implemented APPROX_NEAR_COSINE query for simple searches
- Retained BM25 text search for filtered queries
- Added appropriate logging to indicate which search method is used

## Test Results
- `test_memory_search_basic`: ✅ PASSED (was failing)
- Vector search works correctly without filters
- Text search works correctly with filters
- Both search methods return appropriate results

## Performance Impact
- Vector search is used when possible, providing better semantic matching
- Text search is used as fallback, ensuring functionality with filters
- No performance degradation compared to previous text-only implementation

## Future Considerations
- ArangoDB may improve APPROX_NEAR_COSINE to support filters in future versions
- Consider implementing a hybrid approach that combines vector and text scores
- Monitor ArangoDB releases for enhanced vector search capabilities

## Status
✅ Fixed and tested - memory agent now uses vector search appropriately
