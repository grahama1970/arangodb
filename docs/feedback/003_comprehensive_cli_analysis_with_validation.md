## Detailed Command Analysis

### 1. Search Commands

The search commands provide various methods to find relevant information in the knowledge base.

#### 1.1 BM25 Search
```bash
python -m arangodb.cli search bm25 "query text" --threshold 0.1 --top-n 5 --tags "tag1,tag2"
```

**Purpose**: Find documents based on keyword relevance using the BM25 algorithm.

**Parameters**:
- `query`: The search query text
- `--threshold`: Minimum BM25 score (default: 0.1)
- `--top-n`: Number of results to return (default: 5)
- `--tags`: Optional comma-separated list of tags to filter by
- `--json-output`: Output results as JSON array

**When to use**: When you need lexical matching (exact keywords) rather than semantic similarity. Best for finding documents containing specific terms or phrases.

**Data Validation**: Validates threshold is between 0 and 1, top-n is a positive integer, and query string is not empty.

#### 1.2 Semantic Search
```bash
python -m arangodb.cli search semantic "query text" --threshold 0.75 --top-n 5 --tags "tag1,tag2"
```

**Purpose**: Find documents based on conceptual meaning using vector similarity.

**Parameters**:
- `query`: The search query text to be embedded
- `--threshold`: Minimum similarity score 0.0-1.0 (default: 0.75)
- `--top-n`: Number of results to return (default: 5)
- `--tags`: Optional comma-separated list of tags to filter by
- `--json-output`: Output results as JSON array

**When to use**: When the exact keywords might differ, but the underlying meaning should match. Good for finding conceptually similar content regardless of specific terminology.

**Data Validation**: Validates threshold is between 0 and 1, top-n is a positive integer, and query string is not empty. Also verifies embedding model availability.

#### 1.3 Hybrid Search
```bash
python -m arangodb.cli search hybrid "query text" --rerank --top-n 5
```

**Purpose**: Combine keyword (BM25) and semantic search with optional reranking.

**Parameters**:
- `query`: The search query text
- `--rerank`: Enable cross-encoder reranking
- `--top-n`: Final number of ranked results (default: 5)
- `--initial-k`: Number of candidates from BM25/Semantic before RRF (default: 20)

- `--tags`: Optional comma-separated list of tags to filter by
- `--rerank-model`: Cross-encoder model to use for reranking
- `--rerank-strategy`: Strategy for combining original and reranked scores
- `--json-output`: Output results as JSON array

**When to use**: For best general-purpose relevance, leveraging both keyword matching and conceptual understanding. Often provides more robust results than either method alone.

**Data Validation**: Validates all thresholds are in appropriate ranges, top-n and initial-k are positive integers, and query string is not empty. Checks rerank-model availability when reranking is enabled.
